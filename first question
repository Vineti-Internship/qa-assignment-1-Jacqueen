Test case2: (For USA, China and Great Britain) only check Inputting valid value for the weight.
Test case3: Check if the country we choose can actually change the value of the shipping (as USA, China and Great Britain only consider the actual weight not the volumetric weight).

Test case5: Check the case if the width, length and height are invalid numbers (or one of them is invalid/negative).
